# Front End Developer Assessment:

The company JLR is looking to attract the best talent in positions such as doctors, call center
agents, and support roles in the USA, Nicaragua, and Colombia. To do so, the company is
relying on its website as this is a massive channel, very wide, that allows them to reach out to
several candidates.

This is why, the company JLR is looking for a Front End Developer (Freelance) to create the
career page for them where the candidates (doctors, call center agents, and support roles) can
apply through the job posts

## What do you need to do?

1. Build a prototype in Figma or Adobe XD of the career page. This must be dynamic and
interactive.

   1. It must have the ability to change from English to Spanish.

   2. It must have filters to seek different positions based on the role (doctor, call
center agent, support role) and countries (USA, Nicaragua, Colombia).

   3. The company also wants to highlight who we are and why joining us would be the
best decision for the candidates.

   4. The job posts must contain an H1 title of the position name, a description of the
job, the country where the position is located, and the role (doctor, call center
agent, or support role).

2. Create the career page using any free URL where we can see the prototype
implemented in a web page.

   1. It must look the same as the prototype with the same functionalities.

   2. If you click on “Apply to this job” a form must be delivered to `enter@email.com` (email of your preference).

   3. If the user clicks twice on the same “Apply to this job” CTA it should only
send one form, not two.

   4. It must be responsive to Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile.
